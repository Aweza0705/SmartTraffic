# SmartTraffic
In today’s world of growing urban traffic and smart cities, understanding traffic behavior is more important than ever. Our project aims to make traffic analysis smarter, faster, and more insightful. Instead of just relying on human observation or manual monitoring, we built a system that can automatically detect, count, and classify vehicles, helping traffic authorities or analysts make better decisions and allocate green signal time.

Our inspiration came from a base paper that focused on using YOLO for dynamic traffic signal control. But we wanted to take it in a different direction — instead of controlling signals, we chose to focus on visual traffic analysis, using tools like Canny Edge Detection and YOLOv8 to deliver clear, accurate results.

Throughout the project, we also added features like heatmap generation, PDF reporting, and a simple GUI interface that even non-technical users can operate.
